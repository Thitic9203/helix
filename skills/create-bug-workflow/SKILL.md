  File bug reports on Jira or GitHub: collect target link, format and details, check the board for an earlier decision, falsify the defect, confirm with the user before creating.
  Use when the user picks Create bug from Helix, says /create-bug, or wants a found defect logged ("raise a ticket for this", "log this defect", "เปิดบั๊ก").
  Do NOT use for Playwright runs (testing-ticket), retest after a fix (retest-bug), TC tables (tc-fe-prep / tc-api-prep), or result-sheet updates.

# Create Bug (discovery stub)

**Thin entry for agent skill discovery.** Full procedure: [WORKFLOW.md](../procedures/create-bug-workflow/WORKFLOW.md).

When invoked:

1. First, before any other work, follow [session-start-context.md](../../references/session-start-context.md) (caveman lite + context-mode).
2. Announce once: `Using **create-bug-workflow** to file the bug report.`
3. Read [WORKFLOW.md](../procedures/create-bug-workflow/WORKFLOW.md) and run its progress checklist in order; open each phase or reference file at the step that names it, not before. Never skip a step or gate.

Claude Code shortcut: `/create-bug` → [commands/create-bug.md](../../commands/create-bug.md).

## Contents

Shared reference index with triggers (see also): [skill-reference-index.md](../../references/skill-reference-index.md).

At the start of every run: [shared-preamble.md](../../references/shared-preamble.md), [user-communication.md](../../references/user-communication.md), [long-workflow-todos.md](../../references/long-workflow-todos.md), then [workspace-guide-discovery.md](../../references/workspace-guide-discovery.md) and [intake-one-pager.md](../../references/intake-one-pager.md) on the first response (WORKFLOW Refusal-first).

Bug-filing gates, at the moment named:

- [bug-priority-matrix.md](../../references/bug-priority-matrix.md) — read at Phase A3, before setting any Priority/Severity or a PWMI / FAILED verdict.
- [figma-design-comparison.md](../../references/figma-design-comparison.md) — read when the expected side cites a design frame (Refusal-first, Phase B3).
- [defect-report-completeness.md](../../references/defect-report-completeness.md) — read at Phase C, before the first draft body; a run where every candidate is Dropped writes no draft; a Needs Review candidate is drafted and shown labelled "Needs Review — not filed".
- [bug-draft-template.md](../procedures/create-bug-workflow/references/bug-draft-template.md) — read when drafting; [posting-discipline.md](../procedures/create-bug-workflow/references/posting-discipline.md) — at Phase D, before posting.
- [shared-must-never.md](../../references/shared-must-never.md) — read at Phase D, before the first write (create call, attachment upload or comment).
- [jira-wiki-vs-markdown.md](../../references/jira-wiki-vs-markdown.md), [jira-linebreak-conversion.md](../../references/jira-linebreak-conversion.md), [jira-comment-post-review.md](../../references/jira-comment-post-review.md) — read when the target is Jira: before and after posting any body.
- [non-pass-challenge-gate.md](../../references/non-pass-challenge-gate.md) — read at Phase B3, before any label or BLOCKED line; [result-quality-gate.md](../../references/result-quality-gate.md) is a test-round gate — when filing, apply its layer map in [B3](../procedures/create-bug-workflow/phase-e-falsification.md#result-quality-gate-layer-map-filing).
- [qa-evidence-gates.md](../../references/qa-evidence-gates.md) — read at Phase F, before any completion claim, and at the end of a run that files nothing.
- [qa-closing-shared.md](../../references/qa-closing-shared.md) — read at QA closing, before reporting done, whether or not anything was filed; its cross-ticket conflict check is for testing-ticket and retest-bug only — this workflow's board check is Phase B2.
- Reproducing in a browser: never on its own (steps come only from the reporter); hand it to testing-ticket-workflow unless the user insists.

Also read each only when its trigger fires: [agent-rationalizations.md](../../references/agent-rationalizations.md) (skipping a gate), [helix-session-constraints.md](../../references/helix-session-constraints.md) (first reply), [skill-invocation-discipline.md](../../references/skill-invocation-discipline.md) (switching skills), [qa-debug-discipline.md](../../references/qa-debug-discipline.md) (tool error, env down), [root-cause-investigation.md](../../references/root-cause-investigation.md) (stating a cause); [B2](../procedures/create-bug-workflow/phase-b2-board-check.md), [B3](../procedures/create-bug-workflow/phase-e-falsification.md), [C](../procedures/create-bug-workflow/phase-c-confirm.md), [D](../procedures/create-bug-workflow/phase-d-create.md), [F](../procedures/create-bug-workflow/phase-f-close.md) at their step; [session-closing.md](../../references/session-closing.md) (close-out), [skill-routing.md](../../references/skill-routing.md) (out-of-scope request), [skill-rules-style.md](../../references/skill-rules-style.md) (editing this skill), [proactive-qa-triggers.md](../../references/proactive-qa-triggers.md) (offering a next skill); [customer-escape-prevention.md](../../references/customer-escape-prevention.md) and [round-time-contract.md](../../references/round-time-contract.md) are test-round files, not applied when filing.

## Refusal-first (precondition gate)

All preconditions and refusal rules are in WORKFLOW.md. MUST NOT create issues until the user approves each draft. MUST re-check the tracker/board first (WORKFLOW Phase B2): a defect a prior/closed ticket already settled as intended behavior is not a bug — report it to the user with the reference link instead of filing.

## QA closing (mandatory before "done")

All close-out gates are in WORKFLOW.md and [verify-closing-checklist.md](../../references/verify-closing-checklist.md) (Create bug section). MUST verify each created issue URL before reporting done.

## Dependencies

Run the check for each of these after step 1, before step 2 — check commands and install hints are in [dependencies.md](../../references/dependencies.md):

- GitHub CLI `gh` (GitHub targets)
- Atlassian MCP or Jira REST credentials (Jira targets)
- macOS-only tools (`osascript`, browser fallback)
- Node.js + in-repo guard tools (`tools/retest-guard`) — only when the workspace carries them; when `tools/retest-guard/` is absent, apply the `img-width-param` rule by hand (embed every image bare, `!file.png!`) and say so
- `superpowers:systematic-debugging`
