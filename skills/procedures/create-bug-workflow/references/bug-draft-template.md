# Bug draft template (Helix default)

Use when the user selects **Helix default** format. Every block below is required by the MUST rows of
[defect-report-completeness.md](../../../../references/defect-report-completeness.md) (§1 five questions, §2 repro matrix, §4 resolution options, §5 dev-question gate); Priority and
Severity come only from the [Bug Priority & Severity Matrix](../../../../references/bug-priority-matrix.md).

## Draft layout

```text
━━━ Bug #{n} ━━━
Title: [{Severity}] {Module} — {behavioral one line}

Priority: Lowest | Low | Medium | High | Highest — matrix bug-priority-matrix.md:<LINE> "<cheat-sheet row text, verbatim>"
Severity: Low | Medium | High | Urgent — the value the reporter gave at intake (A3), kept as given
Module: {area}
Confidence: Confirmed | Likely

What happens:
- {observable behavior, one fact per line}

What should happen:
- {expected behavior, one fact per line}
> "{the expected-result line from its source, copied character for character}"
- Source: {design frame / AC id / PRD section / PO decision} — {link}

Why failed: "{the expected-result line, copied character for character}" → {the exact deviation, one observable fact}

User impact:
{who is affected}

Repro matrix (entry point × result, untried = not tested):
| Entry point | Result |
|---|---|
| {entry point 1} | reproduced — {evidence ref} |
| {entry point 2} | not reproduced — {evidence ref} |
| {entry point 3} | not tested |

Steps to reproduce (only steps from the reporter's input or evidence):
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

Resolution options (QA picks neither):
| Option | Decided by | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| The current behavior is what the design intends | spec owner ({PO / reporter}) | update the expected-result text to match; close with no code change |
| The quoted expected result stands | dev ({assignee}) | change `{exact surface / route}` to `{concrete target behavior}`; leave `{the parts that already pass}` untouched |

Fix status: new report — no fix delivered yet

Code reference (if known):
- File: path:line
- Root cause: ...

Environment:
- URL:
- Role / account: {role tag — never a password}
- Browser / viewport:
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Evidence:
- Screenshot: {path or none}
- Console / network: {snippet or none}

## Block rules

- **Severity / Priority** — the one rule is WORKFLOW Phase A3 (Severity as the reporter gave it, also the title
  bracket; Priority from the matrix cell; anything the matrix cannot place is asked). Cite the cheat-sheet row as
  the matrix's own *Verdict line format* does: line number plus the row text copied character for character, never the file name alone.
- **What happens / What should happen** — keep both headings. The verbatim source quote and its link go
  *inside* What should happen, under the expected bullets; they never replace the section.
  Quote the source line verbatim and link it. A paraphrase, a feature name or a
  translation is not an expected side; with no quotable source the candidate is a question, not a bug
  (WORKFLOW Refusal-first).
- **Why failed** — the expected-result line quoted verbatim (the same line as in What should happen) and
  the exact deviation from it, as one observable fact. No quotable line → the candidate is a question, not
  a bug (WORKFLOW Refusal-first).
- **Resolution options** — both rows, each with a named owner in Decided by; name the exact surface to
  change and the parts that must not change. Never pick an option yourself and never edit the ticket's
  expected-result field (contract §4).
- **Fix status** — a new report has no delivered fix; the line says so, which answers the §5 question
  "is the thing I fixed still broken?" for a new bug.
- **Repro matrix** — one row for **every** entry point that could reach the defect. Mark a path you
  did not try `not tested`; never claim the defect occurs via a path with no evidence row.
- **Steps to reproduce** — copy the steps from the reporter's input or evidence only. Never add, merge
  or "complete" a step yourself; a step that seems missing is a question to the reporter (ask in the A3
  follow-up), never an invented line.

## Title rules

- Lead with the Severity bracket (the reporter's intake value) for Jira/GitHub scanability — never a
  priority you derived.
- Behavioral description — not “Bug in login” alone.
- If the project uses a bracketed tag-prefix convention (e.g. `[Area][Feature][Role]`), put **exactly one
  space** after the closing `]` before the description — never run the text straight onto the bracket.
- Keep it concise **but** complete: enough to know the flow + symptom; drop details that already live in
  dedicated fields (they only duplicate).

## Field formatting

Match the target tracker's own convention when it has one.

- Write **What happens** (actual) as **bullet points — one fact per line**, not a single run-on
  paragraph. Reviewers scan bullets; they skip walls of prose. The source quote inside What should happen stays verbatim.
- **Embed the evidence screenshot inline in the actual-result field** when the tracker supports inline
  images (for a new bug create the issue first, attach, then update the body to reference it inline) — not only as a loose attachment — so the
  proof sits next to the claim. Re-render and confirm the image resolved (not a literal `!filename!`).
